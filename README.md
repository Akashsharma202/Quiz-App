# Quizzie

Quizzie is a website that offers users the opportunity to test their knowledge in multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Python, and Java. The difficulty level of the quiz is determined by the user's performance on the first three questions in each language. If the user answers more than two questions correctly, they will be directed to a new page featuring challenging multiple-choice questions, each worth 5 points. However, if the user answers two or fewer questions correctly, they will be presented with easier questions, each worth 1 point.

At the end of the quiz, a scorecard is generated, which is tailored to the selected programming language. Users have the option to switch to a different language and attempt the quiz again. The website also features a profile section where users can access information about their accounts.

To update the quiz questions, an Admin section is available on the website, allowing administrators to add more questions to the database.
